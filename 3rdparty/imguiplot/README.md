This is a simple plotting widget for imgui. 



### inspired by 
I have been looking at https://github.com/soulthreads/imgui-plot, imguis PlotLines and some other places i forgot about. 
I ended up with this. 

### example usage
I built this for laa, and there is plently of code there using it and more or less all the features i think. 
As a starting point: 

https://github.com/mkalte666/laa/blob/master/src/irview.cpp 

The results look like this (older version of laa and imguiplot):
